                            4214</a>. You can even visit our clinic and speak to the receptionist, who will be
                        able to book you in.</p>

                    <h4>Cancelling your appointment</h4>
                    <p>If you have an appointment, but are unable to make it, we expect you to inform us by either
                        calling in<a href="tel:03330124214">0333 012 4214</a> or emailing us <a href="mailto:info@optimizedbodyandmind.co.uk">info@optimizedbodyandmind.co.uk</a>. This
                        is so that we can open appointments to other customers, who may find that slot convenient.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Amending your appointment</h4>
                    <p>If you would like to change your appointment time or day, we advise you getting in touch by
                        calling us on<a href="tel:03330124214">0333 012 4214</a> or emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@optimizedbodyandmind.co.uk">info@optimizedbodyandmind.co.uk</a>. Or
                        you can
                        walk-in and speak to the receptionist, who will be able to tell you the next availability.

                    <h4>Late attendance</h4>

                        there is walk-in appointment, we will prioritise this, as we cannot have other customers
                        waiting.</p>

If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under the Terms & Conditions, if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
                        <br>6. Any abusive behaviour to our staff will not be tolerated and we reserve the right to deny access to our clinic if such behaviour is evident.
